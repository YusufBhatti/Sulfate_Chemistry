Note that due to the need to use the non portable 
function erf (the error function), 
some of the parameters needed in the 
subroutine pm10_pm2p5.F90 are calculated offline.
This also reduces calculations needed to run 
with PM diagnostics.

The program calc_pm_params.f90 does these
calculations. This program is not a part 
of the UM as such and this calculation in unsupported. 

While many Fortran compilers include the error
function not all do and so this program 
may not work with all compilers.

MODULE ukca_tracer_stash

IMPLICIT NONE

INTEGER, PARAMETER :: a_ukca_first   = 1    ! First UKCA tracer (STASH No)
INTEGER, PARAMETER :: a_ukca_last    = 256  ! Last UKCA tracer  (STASH No)

! Maximum number of UKCA tracers
INTEGER, PARAMETER :: a_max_ukcavars = a_ukca_last - a_ukca_first + 1

! Index to relative position.
! A_TR_INDEX(N) gives position in JTRACER for tracer number N.
! Set in SET_ATM_POINTERS.
! A_TR_INDEX(N) is the position, in the list of tracers
! actually present in D1, that tracer number N (in the list
! of all tracers selectable from the user interface) occupies,
! if it is present.
! If tracer number N is absent then A_TR_INDEX(N) is -1.
! Similarly for A_UKCA_INDEX.
! UKCA_tr_StashItem is set up in SET_ATM_POINTERS

INTEGER :: a_ukca_index      (a_max_ukcavars)
INTEGER :: ukca_tr_stashitem (a_max_ukcavars)

! ukca_tr_lbc_stashitem is set up in subroutine inbounda and is only
! referenced if LBC code is active.
INTEGER :: ukca_tr_lbc_stashitem    (a_max_ukcavars)
INTEGER :: ukca_tr_active_lbc_index (a_max_ukcavars)

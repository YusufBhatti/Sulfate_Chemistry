******************************** Code Owners **********************************
*******************************************************************************

The purpose of this page is to list ownership of the major components of the
UM. The definition of components is based on the structure of the FCM
respository of the code - which corresponds to UM sections. Please note the
following considerations:

 * Ownership is not a commitment for the individual to undertake all work
   requested or all reviewing for the owned section
 * Any planned changes to a section should be discussed with the code owner to
   ensure plans are appropriate
 * Code owners should be given the option to be a science/technical reviewer for
   any code that alters their sections
 * Ownership of a component includes all section-option combinations
 * The interface between components needs to be agreed by all affected parties.
 * When passing on code ownership, owners should ensure that this page is
   updated appropriately.
 * Rose meta-data (in rose-meta) will be owned by the appropriate code owner of
   that section.

Note that from UM release 7.1 onwards, coupling is done via OASIS to the NEMO
ocean and CICE sea-ice models. The OASIS, NEMO and CICE codes are held in
separate repositories and are owned by Richard Hill (OASIS & NEMO) and Ann
Keen (CICE).
